        Personal Background:
I was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and moved frequently as a child due to being part of a military family. Growing up, I experienced various communities and schools, which taught me adaptability and resilience.

Professional Background:
In high school, I worked at a local gun range, where I gained firsthand experience in customer service, safety protocol management, and responsibility. Recently, I completed a summer internship as an accounting intern with Hendrick Automotive Group, where I developed practical skills in financial record keeping, auditing, and using accounting software.

Academic Background:
I am currently a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), pursuing a double major in Finance and Accounting. These fields align closely with my interests and professional aspirations, particularly regarding investments and financial analysis.

Background in this Subject:
While I have no formal background in computer science, I have a strong interest in learning Python, specifically to apply it in financial modeling, data analysis, and accounting applications. This class represents my first formal step into the computing field, and I'm excited about the possibilities it offers.

Primary Computer Platform:
My primary computer platform is Windows, which I use consistently for academic and personal activities.

Courses I'm Taking & Why:

ITSC1100 - Introduction to Computer Science Principles: While required as a non-business elective, I anticipate this class will provide valuable skills applicable to my finance and accounting studies.

ACCT 3323 - Intermediate Accounting: This course is a requirement for my majors and essential for deepening my understanding of accounting principles and processes.

ECON 2102 - Principles of Microeconomics: Another required course crucial to developing a fundamental understanding of economic systems and market behaviors that influence finance.

FREN 1502 - French Film: Selected as a non-business elective due to my passion for film and cultural studies. I am eager to explore the cinematic arts within a different cultural context.

INTL 3003 - Terrorism Studies: Another elective chosen based on my personal interest. This class covers political definitions, implications, and the dynamics of terrorism, which fascinates me as a subject of global importance.

Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:
My most prominent hobby is painting, specifically Warhammer 40k miniature painting. It's a meticulous art form that requires precision, creativity, and patience, all of which I thoroughly enjoy.

I'd also like to Share:
This is my first experience with an entirely online class. I'm curious and enthusiastic about observing the differences in learning dynamics compared to traditional, in-person classroom settings.
