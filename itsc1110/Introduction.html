    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Born in Fayetteville and moved around alot as a military child</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> In highschool I worked at a gun range, and over the summer I was an accounting intern for Hendrick Automotive Group</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> UNCC Sophomore, plan on majoring in Finance and Accounting Background in this subject: I have no CS background, but I would like to eventually learn python for applications in finance and accounting.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows</li>
        <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>ITSC1100- I was required to have non-business electives and I believe this class could be useful despite not being a business class.</li>
                <li>ACCT 3323- This is a required class for my majors and it is important for my understanding of accounting processes.</li>
                <li>ECON 2102- This is another required class, and it is the basic microeconomics class which holds knowledge crucial to an understanding of how our financial world works.</li>
                <li>FREN 1502- Another non-business elective, but one that I took because it is something I am interested in. It is a French Film class, and as someone who is interested in film I thought it would be a great opportunity.</li>
                <li>INTL 3003- Yet another non-business elective, and another that I am simply interested in. It is a class on terrorism and goes into political definitions of terrorism amongst other things.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong>My biggest hobby is painting, which includes Warhammer 40k miniature painting.
        </li>
        <li><strong>I’d also like to Share:</strong>This is the first online class I've taken and I'm curious on the differences it might have when compared to an in person class.
        </li>
