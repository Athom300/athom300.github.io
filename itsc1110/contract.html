        I, Ari E. Thomas agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring
2025, itcs1110, Introduction to Computer Science Principles with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I
understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my
work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to
learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
(i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Ari E. Thomas,
04/28/2025
